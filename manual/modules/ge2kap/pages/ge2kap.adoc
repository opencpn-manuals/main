=== Installation

On http://gdayii.ca/index.php[gdayii.ca GE2KAP] website, select
“Downloads” in the website Menubar and find the “GE2KAP” download.
Download and and uncompress the zip file and install. Some zip files
require a password to unzip which is: *phiggins*

Refer to the
http://www.shoreline.fr/PHiggins/GE2KAP/English/index.html[English Help
File -Index.html] also located in the download. EG: From the GE2KAP
installation folder
“file:C:/GE2KAP/GE2KAP.V26.0.0.0/Help/English/index.html” The
*index.html* will provide instructions.

* The *README* is a file in the GE2KAP program folder that, when opened
launches the built-in HELP discussion with your computer's browser. It's
quicker to access the HELP from the first pane of the GE2KAP program by
pressing F1.
* The '*Tutorial*' is named '*Step by Step Procedure*' and is accessed
by clicking on the box with that label on the first pane of the GE2KAP
program or by use of F1 key. Lots of procedures described and they can
also be narrated by Windows.

==== From the Tutorial, Contents of Install Package

. *GE2KAP.exe* The program to execute *GE2KAP.rex*. At first start, it
will also run *Check.rex* to check if all the prerequisites are
installed.
. *Install_Plugin.exe* The program to install the OpenCPN plugin
*ge2kap_pi.dll* for GE2KAP. Do not run this program by itself. The first
time you run GE2KAP.exe, if the plugin is not installed or its the wrong
version, this program will be invoked to install the plugin. It can be
run again by running *Check.rex*.
. *GE2KAP.rex* The GE2KAP program. This is what you run.
. *GE2KAPFuncs.dll* A dll with functions used by GE2KAP. It must be in
the same directory as *GE2KAP.rex*.
. *View.xxx* A program used to view the chart produced. It must be in
the same directory as *GE2KAP.rex*. It will be copied into *View.exe*
the first time GE2KAP runs.
. English.mo/….mo Language files for the various languages supported.
They must be in the same directory as *GE2KAP.rex*.
. *Help* directory Help directory. It must be in the same directory as
GE2KAP.rex.
. *ge2kap_pi.dll* This is the GE2KAP plugin for OpenCPN. It needs to be
copied into the opencpn\plugins directory which is usually _C:\Program
Files\opencpn\plugins_ or _C:\Program Files (x86)\opencpn\plugins_.
.. Then rename it to *ge2kap_pi.dll*.
.. After copying, start OpenCPN and enable the plugin
Options..Plugins..ge2kap Click Enable then OK.
. *Check.rex* checks that all prerequisites are installed, including the
ge2kap_pi plugin.

=== Use of ooREX Language

Paul Higgins uses the ooRexx language in creating GE2KAP. For GE2KAP to
run it needs the ooRexx interpreter installed on the machine (Paul used
to work for IBM). GE2KAP intallation checks if ooRexx has been
downloaded and installed and if not, you are prompted to do so.

ooRexx is an interpreter language. That means the human readable source
code is not compiled to machine code to an executable and this
executable is started but the ooRexx code is given to the interpreter
which translate it to machine code during startup. That is nice for
small programs and test them on the fly.

=== Description & Process

Here is a reasonable technique for putting charts into OpenCPN with a
minimum number of steps and/or geeky user interfaces. It does involve
using GE2KAP, which you can find
*_link:../../../supplementary_software/chart_conversion_manual/chart_conversion.html[Chart
Conversion]_* complete with downloading instructions.

GE2KAP is a great program. I've used it a bunch of times to get imagery
in OpenCPN to show me where rocks, shorelines, etc. really are. But
beware! Even at high magnification (say, 1000 feet view) rocks and
submerged objects may not be visible. Fortunately, we maintain a good
lookout and narrowly avoided learning this lesson the hard way!

If you have a chart that you believe is accurate, for example, from a
cruising guide. The instructions below allow you to display it correctly
in OpenCPN. The process for overlaying a chartlet in OpenCPN using
Google Earth and GE2KAP is actually quite straightforward.

. Get an image of the chartlet. In the case of a cruising guide, take a
photo of the page. Be sure the camera lens is directly above the center
of the chart and the camera is parallel to the chart surface.
. Use Photoshop or GIMP to crop and refine the image. Adjust brighteness
and increase its contrast, to make the final OpenCPN display more
readable. Save the image in a temporary directory or desktop. Any format
– .jpeg, .png .bmp.
. Go to Google Earth and locate the general area where you want the
chartlet to show. Scale the screen image to roughly coincide with the
chartlet boundaries – no need to be precise. Go to View/Reset and reset
both Tilt and Compass.
. Select the *Add Image* Overlay tool on the GE toolbar. (Looks like two
rectangles slightly offset from each other. If there is no toolbar, go
to View and select Toolbar from the pull-down menu.) You will get a
dialog window. Give the chart a name (e.g. localname_PM for a chart from
Pacific Mexico) and browse to where you've saved the image. Don't hit
OK. (If you do, you can get back to the dialog screen by checking
Sidebar under View, right-clicking the overlay name in the sidebar and
selecting Properties.)
. In the dialog window, Slide the Transparency control back and forth to
get a level that allows you to align the chartlet image with the GE
image. Grab any corner to scale the chartlet to the GE image, and grab
the center to move it into position. (Hint: Use the corners rather than
the cross-hair in the center. Align one corner and then the opposite
one. Keep working it until you get it right.)
. Select a transparency level high up on the scale toward Opaque. If you
make the chartlet too transparent you won't be able to read things like
depths and waypoint names; if you make it too opaque it will appear in
OpenCPN with a black border around it, interrupting the flow of the
other chart features. Now click OK. Go to View in the taskbar and
unselect everything, to give you a clean image.
. Open *GE2KAP* and create a chart exactly as you would have done for a
GE image without the chartlet overlay (in other words, just use the left
side of the interface, ignoring everything on the right). Note where
GE2KAP files the chart in your directory structure (in my case,
C:\GE2KAP\GE2KAP.V10.0.6.2\Charts).
. Open *OpenCPN*, select Tools (image of a wrench)/Charts. If the
directory you saved your chart to is already listed, select it and click
_Remove Selected_. Now click _Add Directory_ … Browse to the directory
where you saved the chart, click _Open_, then in the chart dialog window
click *OK*.“ . Your new chart should now appear where it is supposed to
be on the OpenCPN chart.

Good luck!
