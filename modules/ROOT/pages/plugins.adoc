=== Plugin Authors Credit

The diversity and range of the OpenCPN Plugins is quite remarkable.
Users should appreciate the time these authors spent to create this
resource. Plugins have been developed for some time now. There is a very
healthy collaboration, so that at times it is truly impossible to
determine “whose” plugin it is, and since this is one of the major
strengths of Open Source we will not attribute. However it should be
noted that there are a number of authors who are quite prolific. As the
authors come to mind they will be noted below. If you are one of the
authors and your name does not appear, please advise.

=== Programmers

Sean Depagnier, Dave Register, Jean Pierre Pitzef, Dave Cowell, Dirk
Smits, Jon Gough, Mike Rossiter, Salty Paws, Transmitter Dan, Peter
Tulp, Konni, Hakan, Wally Schulpen, Kees Verruijt, Douwe Fokkema, Dave
Deller and there are more.

=== Testers

Many thanks to those who spent many hours helping the authors of these
plugins test and debug.
