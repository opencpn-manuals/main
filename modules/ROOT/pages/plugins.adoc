=== Plugin Authors Credit

The diversity and range of the OpenCPN Plugins is quite remarkable.
Users should appreciate the time these authors spent to create this
resource. There is a very healthy collaboration, so that at times it is impossible to determine “whose” plugin it is. Since this is one of the major strengths of Open Source we will not attribute. However, it should be noted that there are a number of authors who are quite prolific. As the authors come to mind they will be noted below. If you are one of the authors and your name does not appear, please advise.

=== Programmers

Sean Depagnier, Dave Register, Jean Pierre Pitzef, Dave Cowell, Dirk
Smits, Jon Gough, Mike Rossiter, Salty Paws, Transmitter Dan, Peter
Tulp, Konni, Hakan, Wally Schulpen, Kees Verruijt, Douwe Fokkema, Dave
Deller and there are more.

=== Testers

Many thanks to those who spent many hours helping the authors of these
plugins test and debug.
