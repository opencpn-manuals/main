<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GPS Odometer is a plugin for OpenCPN version 5.0 and higher. The
keyword for this GPS Odometer is simplicity. Note that, as this is a GPS
based instrument, it requires GPS data to display any data at all. The
GPS MNEA 0183 sentences RMC and GGA messages is a must. See furter
information below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GPS Odometer contain just these basic functions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An optional Speedometer with both analog and digital readout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Total Distance log, always displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Trip Distance log, always displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional Deparure / Arrival timer with digital readout</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Trip reset button that resets Trip, Departure Time and Arrival Time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An optional Leg Trip time and Distance including Start/Stop Leg and
Leg reset buttons</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_instruments"><a class="anchor" href="#_instruments"></a>Instruments</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The instruments are shown in the above listed order and it is not
possible to change this order. It is however possible to toggle the
optional instruments on or off right-clicking on the instrument panel
and select 'Settings'.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Total distance, Trip distance plus the Trip reset button can not be
toggled off. Just leave the GPS Odometer on screen and reset the trip
counter once the trip is ended (and log book written?) or before the
next trip starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trip will be considered started as soon as the speed increases
above 'Minimum Route Speed', preset to 2 knots (selectable in the
settings menu). The departure date and time will be displayed on the
instrument as the upper value for 'Departure &amp; Arrival'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trip will be considered stopped as soon as the speed decreases
below 'Minimum Route Speed' and the date and time will be displayed on
the instrument as the lower value for 'Departure &amp; Arrival'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the speed then again increases above 'Minimum Route Speed' the trip
be either continued or restarted depending on if the 'Trip reset' button
has been clicked or not. You may even shut down OpenCPN for e.g. a lunch
break, the 'Trip distance' as well as 'Departure &amp; Arrival' times are
remembered until the Trip reset button is clicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Departure and arrival times are displayed according to the ISO
standard 8601 primary alternative ('YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM').</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Total distance' is simply a counter of distance traveled and is not
affected by the reset button. Note that you can edit the 'Total
distance' value in the OpenCPN configuration file e.g. if the GPS
Odometer is replacing another Sumlog instrument. The format is '12345.6'
(one decimal only) and remember to do that when OpenCPN is shut down or
your change will be lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Leg Trip functionality is a bit different as it has higher time
and distance resolution, intended for e.g. tight navigation time and
distance measurements. Like “How far is it between X and Y?” or “How
long time does it take between Y and Z”. Start or resume the distance
and time counters clicking the Start/Stop Leg button, it will count
distance and time until the button is clicked again. Click the Leg Reset
button to zero distance and time and begin a new count session. This
counter does not use 'Minimum Route Speed' setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several parameters can be adjusted in the 'Settings' menu, just
right-click somewhere on the instrument and select to change the
settings. Please do not set 'Min Route Speed' to low or you will get
false trip start/stop times due to position inaccuracies and/or when
anchored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HDOP and Satellites in use values can be adjusted editing the
OpenCPN configuration file, they both default to '4'.<br>
HDOP can be adjusted from 1 to 10 and Satellites in use must be at least
4 but can be increased if required. Do not alter these settings unless
you know what you are doing!</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few notes about GPS signal information, this is what happens if one
more of the RMC and/or GSV/GGA sentences are missing:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>There will be no speed or distance count if NMEA 0183 sentence RMC is
missing nor will the GPS Odometer start displaying data until NMEA 0183
GGA is indicating a valid GPS signal (are using the 'Satellites in use'
and 'HDOP' information). There is also a few seconds delay when powered
up to allow for the system to be proiperly started. Many GPS units are
somewhat inaccurate the first 10 seconds. Note that this is a power up
start delay that has no effect later on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is essential to use a good quality and stable GPS receiver. Some
GPS units are quite unstable when starting (although indicating a valid
fix) and, as all distances are added, this will add to the trip and
total distances or trigger false departure times.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="_bugs_and_inconveniences"><a class="anchor" href="#_bugs_and_inconveniences"></a>Bugs and inconveniences</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few bugs/inconveniences inherited from the original
dashboard as the instrument window downsizing when e.g. removing the
speedometer does not downsize properly. There are also other minor
display size inconveniences but these are corrected just grabbing the
lower right corner and adjust the panel size. Worst case solution is to
restart OpenCPN.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, some of the parameters from the Settings menu does not update the
instruments until OpenCPN is restarted, like the maximum speed setting
in the speedometer.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_installing"><a class="anchor" href="#_installing"></a>Installing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best and most convenient way to install is to use the package
manager but if a suitable version is not availanble you may also build
the application following the standard method compiling outside the
OpenCPN source tree.<br>
There is (currently?) no version available for the Android environment
as I don&#8217;t have either the tools nor the knowledge to do that. Any help
from the community would be appreciated.</p>

<h3 id="_a_final_comment"><a class="anchor" href="#_a_final_comment"></a>A final comment</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did this plugin as I wanted a simple GPS based Odometer. The Logbook
has the option but you may not need all the other stuff in there and
also wants an on-screen solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For 'dry-runs' I recommend either trips recorded using OpenCPN VDR
plugin or gpsfeed+ in a square pattern (getting various speeds).</p>
